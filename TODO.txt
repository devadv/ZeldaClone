Gameplay:





Tests:

1. Simple Map creation with Tiled
2. Test map with different layers
3. How does collision works with these layers? is it possible with Slick2d?
4. How to move the Hero? ( Hero Animation / Map moves)
5. Choose between different colors Link: Green, Red and Blue from Ocarina of Time. You can buy the clothes later in the game.
Green is the color you start your adventure with, blue lets you swim, and Red allows a better protection against fire.
