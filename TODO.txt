---at first add testtilemap3.tmx to index. game gives runtime exception. After that commit and push.
*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*
Basic screen view is 960 x 640 divide by 32 = 30 tiles x 20 tiles.
In testfase different map, later we make one map = 9 basis screen views = 960 * 3 = 2880 = 90 tiles X 640 * 3 =  1920 = 60 tiles
*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*

1. create a test map of 960 x 640 with diffent layers and one object layer with different objects
2. implement this map in a new TestTileMap2 
3. test if there is an collision with some tiles
4. test and experiment with properties on tiles and exam if it is possible to use this. So is there a method in TiledMap that can
look for properties on tiles. 



Gameplay:

*Choose between different colors Link: Green, Red and Blue from Ocarina of Time. You can buy the clothes later in the game.
Green is the color you start your adventure with, blue lets you swim, and Red allows a better protection against fire.





Tests:

1. Simple Map creation with Tiled  * done
2. Test map with different layers * done
3. How does collision works with these layers? is it possible with Slick2d? * done

4. How to move the Hero? ( Hero Animation / Map moves) *( still the player moves not the map, in future game the maps has to move)
