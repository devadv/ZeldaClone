---at first add testtilemap3.tmx to index. game gives runtime exception. After that commit and push.
*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*
Basic screen view is 960 x 640 divide by 32 = 30 tiles x 20 tiles.
In testfase different map, later we make one map = 9 basis screen views = 960 * 3 = 2880 = 90 tiles X 640 * 3 =  1920 = 60 tiles
*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*

1. create a test map of 960 x 640 with diffent layers and one object layer with different objects
2. implement this map in a new TestTileMap2 
3. test if there is an collision with some tiles
4. test and experiment with properties on tiles and exam if it is possible to use this. So is there a method in TiledMap that can
look for properties on tiles. 
5. Ask Linda to make items : heart , monsters and sword. TileSet with : grass, wall, water, stairs



Gameplay:

*Choose between different colors Link: Green, Red and Blue from Ocarina of Time. You can buy the clothes later in the game.
Green is the color you start your adventure with, blue lets you swim, and Red allows a better protection against fire.





Tests:

1. Simple Map creation with Tiled  * done
2. Test map with different layers * done
3. Testing collisions with different layers. *( still the player moves not the map, in future game the maps has to move)
4. How to move the Hero? ( Hero Animation / Map moves)
5. Choose between different colors Link: Green, Red and Blue from Ocarina of Time. You can buy the clothes later in the game.
6. Green is the color you start your adventure with, blue lets you swim, and Red allows a better protection against fire.

# Dungeon Adventure Game (gameplay: Based on Link to the Past).

Basic functionality:

- If you press the actionbutton, The hero swings his sword.
- Animated Spritesheet will be activated.
- A sound will be played

- A monster just walks. 
If a monster and the Hero collide, the Hero loses a life. Unless there's a special event.
De hero met het zwaardje zwaait en het monster 1 tile verwijderd van de hero in de looprichting van de hero staat. 
In dat geval sterft het monster.

- If the hero loses all his hearts, the hero dies.

- If a monster dies, there's 50% chance something spawns.

- If something spawned: 50% chance a green emerald spawns, 25% chance a blue emerald spawns, 25% chance a heart spawns.

- If there is a tile with an item the hero walks over, it will be added.
(Example: He walks over a heart, a heart will be added (unless he has all his hearts).
If he walks over an emerald, the amount of emeralds will be added. (Green = 1, Blue = 5, Red = 20, purple = 50).
